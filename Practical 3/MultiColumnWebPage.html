            A computer is a device that can perform computations and make logical decisions
            phenomenally faster than human beings can. Many of today's personal computers can
            perform billions of calculations in one second&mdash;more than a human can perform
            in a lifetime. Supercomputers are already performing thousands of trillions (quadrillions)
            of instructions per second! To put that in perspective, a quadrillion-instruction-per-second
            computer can perform in one second more than 100,000 calculations for every person
            on the planet! And&mdash;these "upper limits" are growing quickly!
        </p>
        <p>
            Computers process data under the control of sets of instructions called computer
            programs. These programs guide the computer through orderly sets of actions specified
            by people called computer programmers. The programs that run on a computer are referred
            to as software. In this book, you'll learn today's key programming methodology that's
            enhancing programmer productivity, thereby reducing software-development costs&mdash;object-oriented
            programming.
        </p>

            A computer consists of various devices referred to as hardware (e.g., the keyboard,
            screen, mouse, hard disks, memory, DVDs and processing units). Computing costs are
            dropping dramatically, owing to rapid developments in hardware and software technologies.
            Computers that might have filled large rooms and cost millions of dollars decades
            ago are now inscribed on silicon chips smaller than a fingernail, costing perhaps
            a few dollars each. Ironically, silicon is one of the most abundant materials&mdash;it's
            an ingredient in common sand. Silicon-chip technology has made computing so economical
            that more than a billion general-purpose computers are in use worldwide, and this
            is expected to double in the next few years.
        </p>

            Computer chips (microprocessors) control countless devices. These embedded systems
            include anti-lock brakes in cars, navigation systems, smart home appliances, home
            security systems, cell phones and smartphones, robots, intelligent traffic intersections,
            collision avoidance systems, video game controllers and more. The vast majority
            of the microprocessors produced each year are embedded in devices other than general-
            purpose computers.
