    <!-- Two <track> elements are used to provide captions. One is for the default "Chinese" caption, and the other is for "English" caption.

label: This attribute specifies the language label for the caption track.
kind: The kind attribute is set to "subtitles" to indicate that it's a subtitle/caption track.
srclang: This attribute specifies the language of the caption track using language codes (e.g., "zh" for Chinese, "en" for English).
src: You should replace "chinese-captions.vtt" and "english-captions.vtt" with the actual paths to your caption files. Caption files are typically in WebVTT (.vtt) format.
The default attribute on the Chinese caption track makes it the default caption track that will be displayed initially.

With this markup, users can select between "English" and "Chinese" captions using the video player's built-in controls, and "Chinese" captions will be the default choice.
